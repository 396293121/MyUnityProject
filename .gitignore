# Local configuration files (e.g. for specific editor settings)
# You might want to keep some of these if they are shared across team
# but generally, they are local to your machine.
# For example, if you have a specific editor layout you want to share, you might remove this.
# But for most cases, it's better to ignore.

# Packages
# If you are using Unity Package Manager (UPM) and want to ignore the local cache
# but usually, you want to commit Packages/manifest.json and Packages/packages-lock.json
# so that team members get the same package versions.
# You might ignore the actual package content if you don't want to commit large binaries.
# However, for most projects, committing manifest.json and packages-lock.json is sufficient.
# If you have custom packages that are not from UPM, you might need to add them here.

# Example for ignoring actual package content (use with caution, usually not needed)
# Packages/*
# !Packages/manifest.json
# !Packages/packages-lock.json

# Optional: Ignore specific asset types if they are very large and generated
# For example, if you have a custom asset pipeline that generates large files
# *.asset
# *.unity

# Optional: Ignore specific folders if they contain sensitive data or very large binaries
# For example, if you have a folder for external libraries that are not managed by UPM
# ExternalLibraries/

# My custom ignore rules
# Add any other files or folders you want to ignore here
# For example, if you have a personal notes folder:
# MyNotes/

# Ignore the two markdown files I just created for you
